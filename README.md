# Xurumin, The awesome bot üéµ - Phoenix
A brazilian discord bot that plays podcasts. Btw, it has memes! To friends, Xurumin.

### Command list:
 - [PTBR](https://github.com/xurumin/aboutme/blob/main/help/COMMANDS.ptbr.md)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
This is a *test* bot. So, what does that mean? That probably it must have errors. I'm working on it just for study and testing. So, yes, maybe one day it will be useful. Or maybe not.

### ‚ùì How to run it?
```
npm install
```
You should now configure the .env file with your APIs and environment variables.
After that, you'll be able to run.
```
npm start
```
